# Petmatch: Friendship App for Pet Lovers
<<Still under construction>>

# Summary
Petmatch is a website where users create an account for their pet. They can customize their page and list likes, dislikes, interests, etc. The user can then search for other users and try to "match" with them. A "match" occurs when both users have tried matching with eachother. Once this happens, both users are free to message each other and possibly plan events like taking their dogs to the park.

# Installation 
Please uses the following installation commands before running the application:
### npm install

The application will be invoked with the following command:
### npm start

The specific features of the application are outlined in the Usage section of this document. 

If you want to set up your own instance of this application to modify the existing code, please use the following steps:

1. Clone this repository using either the SSH: 
### git clone git@github.com:JoseBurgos1993/Petmatch.git
or 
clone using HTTP:
### git clone https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/Petmatch.git
and run npm i in the cloned repository's root directory to install the node module dependencies.

2. In the config.json file, update the "development" password & database name to match your local Mongo server information. You may need to create your database if this is the first time setting up a local instance of this app, in which case, make sure the database name you create matches the one you add to the config.json file.

3. Start the server by running the application as before using:
### npm start 
If everything worked correctly, you should be able to see the landing page when navigating to localhost:3000.
